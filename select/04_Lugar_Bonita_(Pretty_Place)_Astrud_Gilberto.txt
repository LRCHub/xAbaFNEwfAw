On the road of life I travel
Looking forward, never back
Looking to that dream before me
Leaving old dreams in my track

Lugar bonito, bonito
It's a pretty place, I see
Lugar bonito, bonito
Where this road is taking me

Earth is barren where I walk from
But it's green to where I go
How I'll get there
I'm not certain
When I get there, I will know

Lugar bonito, bonito
It's a pretty place I see
Lugar bonito, bonito
Where this road is taking me

Long and lonely, hard and dusty
Is this road I walk upon?
But the journey's end gets nearer
As the day goes by, gets gone

Lugar bonito, bonito
It's a pretty place, I see
Lugar bonito, bonito
Where this road is taking me

On the road of life I travel
Looking forward, never back
Looking to that dream before me
Leaving old dreams in my track

Lugar bonito, bonito
It's a pretty place, I see
Lugar bonito, bonito
Where this road is taking me
