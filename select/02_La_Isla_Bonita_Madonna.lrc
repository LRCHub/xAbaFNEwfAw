[00:14.71] ¿Cómo puede ser verdad?
[00:26.21] 
[00:23.57] Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
[00:28.92] Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
[00:33.12] A young girl with eyes like the desert
[00:38.34] It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[00:58.84] 
[00:42.86] Tropical the island breeze
[00:45.17] All of nature wild and free
[00:47.59] This is where I long to be
[00:49.88] La isla bonita
[00:56.88] 
[00:52.52] And when the samba played
[00:54.82] The sun would set so high
[00:57.08] Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[00:59.38] Your Spanish lullaby
[01:09.38] 
[01:11.51] I fell in love with San Pedro
[01:16.90] Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
[01:22.06] Te dijo te amo
[01:26.53] I prayed that the days would last
[01:29.46] They went so fast
[01:37.96] 
[01:30.92] Tropical the island breeze
[01:33.15] All of nature wild and free
[01:35.55] This is where I long to be
[01:38.08] La isla bonita
[01:45.08] 
[01:40.47] And when the samba played
[01:42.96] The sun would set so high
[01:45.07] Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[01:47.46] Your Spanish lullaby
[01:57.46] 
[01:59.82] I want to be where the sun warms the sky
[02:04.21] When it's time for siesta you can watch them go by
[02:09.25] Beautiful faces, no cares in this world
[02:13.74] Where a girl loves a boy, and a boy loves a girl
[02:37.74] 
[02:30.88] Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
[02:35.96] It all seems like yesterday, not far away
[02:56.46] 
[02:40.49] Tropical the island breeze
[02:42.82] All of nature wild and free
[02:45.18] This is where I long to be
[02:47.43] La isla bonita
[02:54.43] 
[02:50.38] And when the samba played
[02:52.65] The sun would set so high
[02:54.73] Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[02:57.17] Your Spanish lullaby
[03:07.17] 
[03:01.07] Tropical the island breeze
[03:03.25] All of nature wild and free
[03:05.66] This is where I long to be
[03:07.96] La isla bonita
[03:14.96] 
[03:10.65] And when the samba played
[03:13.26] The sun would set so high
[03:15.22] Ring through my ears and sting my eyes
[03:17.69] Your Spanish lullaby
[03:27.69] 
[03:22.23] La la la la la la la
[03:28.15] Te dijo te amo
[03:35.15] 
[03:34.04] La la la la la la la
[03:37.98] Él dijo que te ama
[03:46.98] 
[03:48.73] La isla bonita
